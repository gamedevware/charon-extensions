# Charon UI Extensions

This repository contains example projects for building **custom UI extensions** for [Charon](https://github.com/gamedevware/charon), a data modeling and game data editing tool.  
Charon supports a plugin architecture using **Web Components** packaged as **NPM modules**, allowing developers to integrate custom field, grid, or schema editors.

## 📦 Repository Structure

This repository includes both **React** and **Angular** implementations of custom field editors, along with shared type definitions:

```
